# Agent Purge CronJob
# Runs daily to hard-delete agents past retention period (30 days after soft delete)
# 
# Retention flow:
# 1. Agent calls DELETE /agents/me → sets deleted_at, clears sensitive data
# 2. This job runs daily at 3 AM UTC
# 3. Agents with deleted_at < (now - 30 days) are hard-purged
# 4. Minimal audit record kept (purged_at timestamp, anonymized ID)
